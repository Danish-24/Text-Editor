          Verde
------------------------------

Verde is a lightweight text editor written in Odin with SDL3 + OpenGL for rendering.
This is an early-stage project.

Build Instructions
------------------
Prerequisites:
- Odin compiler
- SDL3 installed on your system
- OpenGL 3.3 or higher runtime available

Linux / macOS:
1. Install SDL3
  - I dont think SDL3 is available
    in most of package managers, so
    might have to build from source.

2. Build:
       ./build.sh

Windows:
1. Get SDL3:
   - Either install it system-wide, OR
   - Place SDL3.dll next to the compiled verde.exe binary
2. Build:
      ./build.bat
